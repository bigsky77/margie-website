Margie Judd is an accomplished academic, film-maker, and photographer currently based at the University of Nevada, Reno.  Her academic work focuses on 19th-Century American Literature, silent-film and the American West. 

Margie's research focuses on the intersection of literature, cinema, and societal views on poverty. Her dissertation, “The Mystery of Misery: Middle-Class Representations of Poverty, 1885-1915,” explores the evolution of middle-class masculinity in realism literature and silent film. 

In 2022, Margie was awarded the prestigious Bilinski Fellowship for outstanding teaching and research.
